## Profile

Interested in learning, coding and acquiring new skills. It gets boring when things don't offer much variety. In order to make projects more compelling I have to learn some new programming tech and apply it. This leads me to be skilled in everything, but master of nothing.

## Skills

- **Programming**. Speciality: learn fast, apply, forget.
- **Problem Solving**. Speciality: solve in ways that everyone can think of, but nobody does.
- **Design**. Speciality: design anything and be proud of, but never really happy.
